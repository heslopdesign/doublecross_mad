# crossfire_mad
A variant of the Half-Life Multiplayer Death Match Map crossfire.


## Change crossfire: Creating crossfire_mad.
For many Half-Life Deathmatch players the gluon gun was considered a weapon that made the matches no fun.
That was reason for MadDEMENTOR, author of this modified map in which there is no weapon_egon.

Enjoy and share this greeat addition to the HLDM maps.
